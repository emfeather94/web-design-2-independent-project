    <h1>ABOUT PATTY B</h1>

    <article>
      <p>My fitness journey began early in high school. As a once smaller teen, I wanted to be able to jump higher so that I could have a shot at competing in volleyball. I decided to start with some bodybuilding training and after a while, moved to targeted volleyball specific training. After staying consistent with my training and seeing improvements, I became hooked with strength development. I began coaching different sports (volleyball, soccer, basketball) and started designing various strength programs for friends.

      <p>I graduated from Health and Fitness Promotion at College Boreal, giving me the ability to obtain professional certification in personal training. After one year working in the field, I decided to go back to school to obtain a registration in massage therapy (RMT), which would not only help me understand the human body at a deeper level, but to also allow me to provide an additional service to current and future clients.

      <p>With both of these certifications, I am extremely knowledgeable of the needs, imbalances and weaknesses a client may have in their body. I am able to understand how to correct problem areas in a client’s body, while also educating them to increase awareness of their own body with the ultimate goal of decreasing future risk of injury. I look forward to helping you on your road to recovery and being a trustworthy resource to keeping your body healthy!</p>
